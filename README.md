# Basic C Programs

This repository contains a collection of simple C programs designed to help beginners learn and practice programming in the C language. Each program focuses on a specific concept and serves as a stepping stone for building a strong foundation in programming.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/basic-c-programs.git
```

2. Navigate to the basic-c-programs directory:

```sh 
cd basic-c-programs
```
3. Compile the factorial.c program using a C compiler. For example, using gcc:

```sh
gcc factorial.c -o factorial
```
4. Run the compiled executable:
```sh
./factorial
```
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter a positive integer for which you want to calculate the factorial.

The program will display the calculated factorial of the input integer.

Experiment with the program by trying different input values.

**Feel free to explore other C programs in this repository and follow similar steps to compile and run them.**

## Programs

### 1. Factorial Number Program

The **Factorial Number Program** calculates the factorial of a given positive integer. It demonstrates the use of loops to implement the factorial calculation. The user provides an input integer, and the program outputs the factorial of that number.

### 2. Fibonacci Series Program

The **Fibonacci Series Program** calculates the number present at the specific position in fibonacci series. It demonstrates the use of recusrion to find the number.

### 3. Teperature Converter Program

The **Temperature Converter Program** converts the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa. It demonstrates the use of functions and switch statements to implement the conversion.

### 4. Guess the Number Game

The **Guess the Number Game** is a simple game in which the user has to guess a randomly generated number. The user has 5 tries to guess it right. It demonstrates the use of random number generation and loops to implement the game.

### 5. Multiplication Table Program
The **Multiplication Table Program** displays the multiplication table of a given number. Multiplier can be of any floating point data type. It demostrates the use of functions and loops to implement the multiplication table.

 ### 6. Prime Number Program
The **Prime Number Program** checks whether a given number is prime or not. A Simple a readable program.

### 7. Palindrome Range Program
The **Palindrome Range Program** prints all the palaindrome numbers within a specific range. It demonstrates the use of loops to implement the palindrome range.
