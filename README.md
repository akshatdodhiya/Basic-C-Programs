# Basic C Programs

This repository contains a collection of simple C programs designed to help beginners learn and practice programming in the C language. Each program focuses on a specific concept and serves as a stepping stone for building a strong foundation in programming.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/basic-c-programs.git
```

2. Navigate to the basic-c-programs directory:

```sh 
cd basic-c-programs
```
3. Compile the factorial.c program using a C compiler. For example, using gcc:

```sh
gcc factorial.c -o factorial
```
4. Run the compiled executable:
```sh
./factorial
```
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter a positive integer for which you want to calculate the factorial.

The program will display the calculated factorial of the input integer.

Experiment with the program by trying different input values.

**Feel free to explore other C programs in this repository and follow similar steps to compile and run them.**

## Programs

### 1. Factorial Number Program

The **Factorial Number Program** calculates the factorial of a given positive integer. It demonstrates the use of loops to implement the factorial calculation. The user provides an input integer, and the program outputs the factorial of that number.

### 2. Fibonacci Series Program

The **Fibonacci Series Program** calculates the number present at the specific position in fibonacci series. It demonstrates the use of recusrion to find the number.

### 3. Temperature Converter Program

The **Temperature Converter Program** converts the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa. It demonstrates the use of functions and switch statements to implement the conversion.

### 4. Guess the Number Game

The **Guess the Number Game** is a simple game in which the user has to guess a randomly generated number. The user has 5 tries to guess it right. It demonstrates the use of random number generation and loops to implement the game.

### 5. Multiplication Table Program
The **Multiplication Table Program** displays the multiplication table of a given number. Multiplier can be of any floating point data type. It demostrates the use of functions and loops to implement the multiplication table.

 ### 6. Prime Number Program
The **Prime Number Program** checks whether a given number is prime or not. A Simple a readable program.

### 7. Palindrome Range Program
The **Palindrome Range Program** prints all the palaindrome numbers within a specific range. It demonstrates the use of loops to implement the palindrome range.

### 8. Student Grade Program
The **Student Grade Program** calculates the grade of a student using four different marking schemes namely, CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average), GPA (Grade Point Average), Percentage and Letter grade. It uses the concept of strings and pointers for letter grade calculation.

### 9. Armstrong Number Program
The **Armstrong Number Program** checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. It demonstrates the use of loops and math library to calculate the Armstrong number.

### 10. Tax Calculator Program
The **Tax Calculator Program** calculates the gst tax of a given amount. It also displays the amount by deducting the inclusive tax from it.

### 11. Character Counter Program
The **Character Counter Program** calculates the number of characters present in a string. It uses the functions present in string.h header file.

### 12. Area Program
The **Area Program** calculates the area of a circle, rectangle, square, and triangle.

### 13. Words Counter Program
The **Words Counter Program** calculates the number of words present in a string. It counts the number of spaces or a new-line character after a string to calculate the number of words.

### 14. Decimal To Binary
The **Decimal To Binary Program** converts a decimal number to its binary equivalent.

### 15. Buzz Number Program
The **Buzz Number Program** checks whether a given number is a buzz number or not. A buzz number is a number which is either divisible by 7 or has 7 in it. For example, 14 is a buzz number because it is divisible by 7, whereas 23 is not a buzz number because it does not has 7 in the end neither it is divisible by 7.

### 16. Automorphic Number Program
The **Automorphic Number Program** checks whether a given number is an automorphic number or not. An automorphic number is a number whose square ends with the same digits as the number itself. For example, 25 is an automorphic number because its square is 625 and it ends with the same digits as the number itself.

### 17. Neon Number Program
The **Neon Number Program** checks whether a given number is a neon number or not. A neon number is a number whose square is equal to the sum of digits of the number. For example, 9 is a neon number because its square is 81 and the sum of digits of 9 is 9 which is equal to its square.

### 18. Duck Number Program
The **Duck Number Program** checks whether a given number is a duck number or not. A Duck number is a positive number which has zeroes present in it, For example 5640, 60245048, 9080604 are all Duck numbers.
